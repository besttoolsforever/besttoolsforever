👋 Hi, I'm Luiz Eduardo

📌 My journey in development began in 2009 by tweaking plugins and templates on CMS platforms (like Joomla and WordPress). This was my first direct contact with code, even before starting my technical training.

🔧 In 2024, while working remotely, I identified the need to automate repetitive tasks. I developed utilities in JavaScript and HTML for cleaning and standardizing text (capitalization, upper/lower case conversion), as well as a simple timer for time management—and to keep my lunch from burning.
Later, I consolidated these projects onto a single page: https://wdv.com.br/ferramentas

📊 During my undergraduate studies, for my final thesis project, I developed a text analysis dashboard that counted characters and identified the most frequent words. This tool also proved useful for Text-to-Speech (TTS) applications, as it included a Words Per Minute (WPM) counter with an innovative feature: the ability to freely adjust the reading speed.

🔐 To meet practical demands, such as securely creating email accounts, I developed a generator for strong and memorable passwords, applying best practices for randomness and usability. Available in a "Matrix" version (link) and a "clean" version in the toolkit.

🔍 To optimize access, I centralized all the tools onto a single page, adding:

A custom search bar powered by DuckDuckGo.

📄 The need to create a resume led me to build a resume generator in HTML/CSS, inspired by professional templates and optimized with an A4 layout for printing.

⚡ Each project was born from the need to solve a real-world problem and was consequently made open-source. This has solidified my GitHub as a portfolio of practical and accessible solutions.
