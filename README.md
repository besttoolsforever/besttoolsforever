👋 Hi, I’m Eduardo from @besttoolsforever!

👀 I’m interested in learning, teaching, relaxing, working hard, music, culture, and the environment - I'm interested in so many things!

🌱 I’m currently learning about testing multiple functionalities of artificial intelligence and its application in various fields.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects - I haven't been invited to collaborate yet, but I always invite people to collaborate on my ideas and projects.

📫 How to reach me: contato@wdv.com.br

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I was born in the 90s, saw the world change so much, and remember every change vividly. I'm the best programmer in the world without knowing any language other than Portuguese, Spanish, English, and a few words in Japanese.
